      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Seattle native, a self-taught programmer with a background in Philosophy, currently building web applications for small businesses in the region.</p>
      <h4>Philosophy</h4>
      <p>My focuses in Philosophy were (1) phenomenology and the advent of German Existential philosophy, (2) American Romantic philosophy, namely Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, (3) the ordinary language philosophy of Stanley Cavell, and (4) Ancient Greek philosophy. I also studied Ancient Greek for several years.  You can find my master's thesis in SUNY Stony Brook's catalogue.</p>
      <h4>Web</h4>
      <p>I became a web developer in the usual way: I had a problem that I wanted to solve (organizing lots of paper) and I had a perverse instinct teling me that I ought to build a tool from scratch to solve it.  I never finished the project, but it launched me into a persistent fascination with programming and delight in building applications.</p>
      <p>I switched careers three years ago and started by own web development business.  It began with small markup contracts and front-end work, but I worked my way down the LAMP stack until I was designing relational databases and building web applications.</p>
      <h4>Full-stack JavaScript</h4>
      <p>I recently had the opportunity to go through Code Fellows' full-stack JavaScript accelerator.  It was a two-month sprint through modern best practices, with emphasis on testing, collaboration, and full use of build tools.</p>
      <h4>Extra Curricular</h4>
      <p>I helped found a non-profit "incubator",&mdash;a workspace and community,&mdash; for writers and their kindred. I work at our home in Pioneer Square several nights a week.</p>
